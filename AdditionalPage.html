During Vesak Poya, the Buddhist temples are particularly busy. Another lovely way to pay honor to Lord Buddha is with pandols. They are enormous, board-like structures that depict scenes from the Jataka Katha, or stories of the Blessed One. Thousands of colored blinking lights cover the entire building and each of its component parts.')">

The names for nativity in their respective languages—Navidad in Spanish, Natale in Italian, and Nol in French—are all probably used in that order. The term Christmas in German means holy night. Christmas has also evolved into a secular family holiday that is celebrated by both Christians and non-Christians alike, free of any Christian traditions, and characterized by an ever-expanding exchange of gifts. Santa Claus, a legendary character, is central to this secular Christmas celebration.')">
