    <!-- Introductory text -->

    <p>First of all, it is not Indian food and not “almost like Indian food”, which is what a lot of people tend to believe when they first arrive to the island (myself included, I have to shamefully admit). The concept of eating rice with several different curries is similar, but everything else from main ingredients to cooking techniques to spices vary.
        There’s definitely South Indian influence in Lankan cuisine, especially when it comes to short eats (street snacks), but the two have distinctly different flavors.</p>

        

    <p  id="spices">Spices are another essential ingredient in any Sri Lankan kitchen. Some of the most popular spices are chili powder, turmeric, mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. Curries are usually prepared with one of the two curry blends: roasted curry powder (for meat and fish)
        and raw curry powder (vegetables and lentils). Fresh karapincha (curry leaves) gives Sri Lankan curries their distinct aroma. </p>

    <p>Spices and coconut milk are always generally used to make the Sri Lankan cuisine. Sri Lankan food is generally considered to be more spicier than Indian food because of various types of chilli used. As a matter of fact Sri Lankan cuisine is considered to be among the hottest and spiciest cuisine in the world. However,
         tourist hotels prepare most Sri Lankan foods to favour the foreign palate since most people aren't used to very spicy food</p> 


    <p>Second, traditional Sri Lankan food is not all about rice and curry. Don’t get me wrong, Sri Lankans do eat more rice in one sitting than most other nationalities in a month. 
        But rice and curry is not all Sri Lankan cuisine has to offer. With so many ethnicities living in this small country you can’t forget about Tamil, Burgher, and Muslim dishes that
         are also a part of the local food scene. 

    </p>    

    <p>Sri Lankan food includes a lot of naturally vegan options thanks to the use of coconut oil and coconut milk. Following a vegetarian or vegan diet is fairly easy on the island as long as you choose traditional Sri Lankan dishes. 
        If you are on a gluten-free diet, it also shouldn’t be a problem. Not only is rice the most popular choice of carbs, but rice flour is actively used in baking and making sweets. </p>
        <p>Sri Lankan cuisine is very unique and exotic. The culinary delicacies of Sri Lanka is very aromatic and healthy. Most of the time the recipes have some influence from the colonists and Indian and Arab traders from back in time.

            The best thing about Sri Lankan food is that the same dish is made in different ways, especially when it comes to different regions in the country, people make a lot of variations to the way a particular dish is made but at the end of the day
             it always turns out to be mouth-watering.</p>

<!-- Breakfast -->

<h1 id="breakfas">Breakfast</h1>
<br>
<h2 id="roast_paan">Roast Paan</h2>
<img  src="roat_pan.JPG" id="roast">
<p id="roast_pan">If I had to choose one breakfast meal to eat for the rest of my life, it would be Sri Lankan roast paan with pol sambol and dhal curry (more about pol sambol and dhal curry below). Just so you know, “roast” is pronounced “ros”. For the longest time I thought “ros” is a Sinhalese word until somebody explained that it’s “roast” meaning that paan (bread) has been roasted. Roast paan is very thin and looks like a slice of bread rather than a bread loaf, but that’s what makes it so crispy when baked. It is sold in street shops and bakeries and best enjoyed fresh 
    and hot out of the oven along with dhal curry and pol sambol. </p>
<br>
<h2 id="Milk_rice">Milk Rice</h2>
<img src="milk_rice.JPG" id="milkRice">
<p id="milkRice">Kiribath, or Sri Lankan milk rice, is one of the most traditional foods, usually prepared for special occasions like New Year, weddings, or a birth of a child. Rice is boiled until soft, then coconut milk is added to make it creamy and sticky. Afterwards, kiribath is arranged on a plate and shaped like a cake to be cut into diamond-shaped pieces. You can have kiribath with lunu miris (spicy onion relish) or seeni sambol (sweet onion relish). Both will make it savory. If you have a sweet tooth pour some kithul treacle over your 
    piece of kiribath.</p>
<br>
<br>


<!-- Lunch -->
<h1 id="lunch">Lunch</h1>
<br>
<h2 id="R&C">Rice & Curry</h2>
<img src="rice_curry.JPG">
<p id="riceCurry">Rice and curry and lunch are synonymous in Sri Lanka. While it may seem, when you first 
    arrive to the island, that Sri Lankans eat rice and curry three times a day, it is not so. I am guilty of thinking that myself. It is not impossible for someone to eat rice and curry for breakfast or (in rare cases) for dinner, but that’s not common. You should also 
    keep in mind that there are dozens of curries in Sri Lankan cuisine. It’s easy to fall under impression that people are eating the same thing for lunch every day. But while you do indeed eat rice and curry, curries almost never repeat day in and day out. Pretty much any kind of meat, fish, vegetable, fruit, leaf, or nut can be cooked into a curry. Now imagine how
     many options you have. </p>

<br>
<h2 id="curry">Spicy Chicken Curry</h2>
<img src="curry.JPG">
<p id="Ccurry">One of the most popular curries of all is spicy chicken curry. Although vegetarian diet is not very widespread, many Sri Lankans prefer not to eat beef and pork, so chicken is the meat of choice. I would go as far as to say that chicken is even more popular than fish. Many Sri Lankans will fight me on this, but I stand my ground. Chicken is always cooked on a bone and
     without adding coconut milk. </p>
<br>
<br>



<!-- Dinner -->
<h1 id="dinner">Dinner</h1>
<br>
<h2 id="roti">Kottu Roti</h2>
<img src="kottu.JPG">
<p id="Krotti">Roti is Sri Lankan flat bread that comes in many varieties. I wrote
     above about pol roti – flat bread made with addition of scraped coconut.
      Another popular option is godamba roti, almost paper-thin, stretchy, oily pancakes.
       For kottu roti, those thin pancakes are cut into pieces and mixed with vegetables, meat, and spices on a grill. Usually the cook uses two metal blades to cut and mix kottu roti. The sound of the blades hitting the grill is one that you will recognize wherever you travel in Sri Lanka. I always say that one knows there’s kottu nearby not because of its smell, but because of the sound. 
       Kottu can be made with chicken, crab, egg, or vegetables. 
</p>

<br>
<h2 id="thosai">Thosai(Pancake)</h2>
<img src="thosai.JPG">
<p id="Thosai">Thosai (pronounced more like “tosse”) is freaking confusing! Possibly,
     the most confusing food of all in Sri Lanka. 
     Some people say that thosai is Sri Lankan name for Indian dosa. Others say that they are two different things. Whenever I show thosai in Instagram stories and call it “thosai”, someone inevitably sends a message: “It’s dosa!”. Next time I show the same damn pancake and say “dosa”, then somebody else corrects me: “It’s thosai”. So if you know what the deal is, please, explain in comments!
